# Bock: Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks

I´m sitting in my office, working on the third Powerpoint presentation this day. The current presentation already has 20 slides filled with different numbers and graphs. I know that it will be boring to follow it. I also know that I won’t convene any major messages.
But conveying messages is an important part of my job. I want to inform my team about data and analysis results from our Monitoring and Evaluation System, or our commissioning party about our process, or the general public about what we are doing. The idea of telling stories to convey a message is rather present at my job. But I never learned how to do it right.
“No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” (D. Kahnemann).
Looking for a book on Storytelling, I was recommended “Storyworthy” by Matthew Dicks. And after reading the book I´m very glad for the recommendation. I found “Storyworthy” and excellent and very entertaining introduction into the world of professional storytelling. The author gives very practical tips on all stages of the storytelling process, illustrating his tips with his own stories. So, here are my takeaways:

# My learnings
1.	Vulnerability: Talking about shameful a foolish moment is much more engaging. “Honesty is attractive”.
Example: I can strongly relate to this observation. In my job we are regularly producing “Success Stories”. I can barely relate nor remember any of these kinds of stories. As the audience it is often easy to detect or to suspect “bullshit” beyond these “shiny” Success Stories.

## Story collection:
1.	“Homework for Live” (write down the most important event of the day every evening). 
2.	“First last best” (use prompts like “Trouble”; “Travel” and find a first, last, best, worst of each. Check if results can be turned into stories/ anecdotes).
Examples: These tips are fun to implement. Probably slightly more applicable to find personal stories then work-related ones. 

## Story Crafting
1.	“Five Second moment”: Every story should be about a moment where (in my personal live) something changed fundamentally. The rest of the story is crafted around this “5 second moment”. “Change is key”. “You must begin and end your story in entirely different states of being.” Clearly identify the moment. It should be the end of the story.
Example: Those don’t have to be monumental changes. This technic is used in most movies etc. E.g. when Frodo decides that he will continue to carry the ring.

2.	Beginning of a story: Should be the opposite of the end (5 second moment). Start with a forward movement (already on our way). Don’t set expectations (“This is hilarious”). Start as close to the end as possible (fewer locations).

3.	Stakes: Stories need stakes to keep the listener listening. Strategies to increase stakes are:
a.	The Elephant: Tell the audience right in the begging what it should expect. “It is easy to stop listening”. The audience should wonder how the story turns out. The colour of the Elephant can be changed at the end of the story (e.g. from happy to sad).
b.	Backpacks: Increase anticipation about a coming event (tell audience about a plan, hopes, fears before moving the story forward). Example: Movies sometimes show the plan for a robbery or escape plan.
c.	Hourglass: Slow down things before an important sentence (longer descriptions etc.).
d.	Crystal Ball: Make a false prediction inside the story (audience wonders if the prediction will prove true). Prediction needs to be reasonable. 

4.	Locations: The audience most know at every moment where I´m in the story, a concrete physical location (have an idea, own imagination). “Movie in the mind of the listener”.
Example: I really can relate to this. Very easy to implement.

5.	“And”: Use “but” and “therefore” (as well as synonyms) instead of “and”. I want to signal change.
6.	Be short: “Fewer words rule”. “The longer you speak, the more engaging, amusing, and captivating you must be”. 
Examples: This is very relatable but also very hard to do. Maybe set myself very strong time limits7 before preparing a presentation etc.

7.  Technics for humour: Laughter is often the result of a surprise. “Milk Cans and a Baseball” (the punchline/ surprise needs to come last). “Babies and Blenders” use words together that are not often used together e.g. “babies” and “assholes”, use exaggeration. 

## Presenting a Story
1.	Present tense: Use present tense for the story if possible. It will bring audience a little close to the story, create more immediacy. 
2.	Success stories: failure is more engaging. “Malign yourself”, “Marginalize your accomplishments”. Tell success stories as step-by-step stories.

## General Tips (also for speeches):
1.	End your talk in less than the allotted time
2.	Don’t praise yourself.
3.	Never mention the weather or the temperature.
4.	“A one-hour meeting is stealing one hour of every person in the room”. Think closely how to present information (could have been delivered via email, entertain, engage, inform).

## Favourite Quote from the book:
“We are the sum of our experiences, the culmination of everything that has come before. The more we know about our past, the better we know ourselves. The greater our storehouse of memory, the more complete our personal narrative becomes.” (P. 75).

“My hands do not build or repair, they purchase an replace.” 😉
