# Occam´s Razor

“It is generally understood in the sense that with competing theories or explanations, the simpler one, for example a model with fewer parameters, is to be preferred.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor 

If there are more than one hypothesis for the same prediction, the ones with the fewest assumptions and least complexity are to be preferred. One major reason for this is the scientific method: Simpler hypotheses are better testable (falsifiability criterion). All additional assumptions introduce possibilities of error.
A related idea from the machine learning space is “overfitting”. Models with two many parameters that fit the training data very close, might have less predictive power than simpler models that fit the training data worse but generalize better (bias vs variance).

## My thoughts
I can see the value of such a heuristic for forming opinions about topics with competing explanations. Acknowledging that each additional assumption in a theory potentially introduces new errors, favours explanations that do with less (first principle thinking). In the space of conspiracy narratives that quite often rely on many assumptions, for example an interest and capabilities in conspiracists to conduct a large-scale operation. Or using Hanlon's razor "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
