A few general lessons regarding the use of statistics.

1. Base rate Fallacy: Ignoring the base rate (e.g. general prevelance) of a Statistic. Always calculate probabilities to avoid this (e.g. getting many false positives altough the test is good because of a high base rate).
2. Difference in Differences method: Quasi experiment to test counterfactuals. Compare data between between to similiar test subjects (e.g. countries) after an intervention in one of them.
3. Always ask if a statistic I read is a big number (esp. when reading percentages). 
4. Systematic Review: Metastudies using data from multiple individual studies.
