# About

Hi there! My name is Mathis and I like learning new stuff. During the last years I was looking for ways to retain information learned better and to grasp basic concepts more clear. This is especially challenging for me if the content of the materials learned is outside of my daily work/ discussions in peer groups.

Following the advice and reasoning on this [Blogpost: Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), 
I`ll try to collect and structure some of my learnings on this blog.

The blog will contain the following kinds of posts:
1. Learnings from books I read (Posts will be marked with "Book:...")
2. Learnings from podcasts and other media (Interesting:...)
3. Math (Math:...)
4. Programming (Programming:...)
5. Machine Learning (Machine Learning:...)

LetÂ´s see how that goes.
