# Interesting: Interesting:_Fermi_Calculation

My understanding is that a Fermi Calculation is a rough first approximation of a problem,
where I dont have any data or much prior knowledge and have to make justified guesses about variables and
quantities (and their variance or lower/ upper bound).

## Procedure (simple)

1. Collect data (quantities) of Parts of the problem that can be obtained/ known.
2. Calculate the unknown quantity based on those parts (different methodologies).

## Advantage
1. Result is often in the right order of magnitude because over and underestimations of the sub-parts cancel out.
2. Estimations of the sub-parts is quite good and close the true value.
3. It is easy to falsify and correct individual sub-parts.

## Example
