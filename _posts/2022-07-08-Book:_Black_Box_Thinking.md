# Book: "Black Box Thinking" by Matthew Syed

This book is about decision making and learning in complex circumstances.

My learnings from this book are the following:

## Situation Analysis: Mistakes, Complexity, Biases

1. **Effective learning from mistakes is essential**: Accepting failure is hard (self-justification mechanisms). We need institutions/mechanisms to identify and learn from mistakes.

**Example**: Until the 19th century bloodletting was a recognized treatment (very few clinical trials at that point). In the airospace the use, incl. analysis and distribution of information, of blackboxes is one effective mechanism to learn from mistakes.

2. **Good systems to track failures are essential**: Instant feedback(mechanisms); clear goals; considering different kinds of data (e.g. "winners curse"); open failure culture;

**Example**: The Toyoto Production System ("Any employee in the Toyota Production System has the authority to stop the process to signal a quality issue" [Wikipedia The Toyota Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way)). People need to be encouraged to report issues and mistakes.

3. **The world and most systems are too complex to understand.**

**Example**: Philip Tetlock showed in a multiyear study that experts rarly make accurate predictions and are often not held accoutable for wrongful predictions.

4. **Cognitive Biases (Dissonances) that impede learning from mistakes**: Disposition effect (e.g. loosing money is much more painful than winning money is nice); Cognitive Dissonance (we donÂ´t like information that challenges our believes and will try to resolve those by producing a story); Our memory is not very precis; Confirmation bias (we always try to confirm our hypothesis; Hindsight Bias (in hindsight it is hard to free ones mind from the outcome of an event to analyse it); Narrative fallacy (we love simple stories and explanations, intuitive stories).

**Example**: "For if we are uncritical we shall alawys find what we want: we shall look for, and find, confirmations, and we shall look away from, and not see, whatever might be dangerous to our pet theories." (Karl Popper)

## How to deal with complexity, failure, biases

5. **Testing and adapting is essential**: Produce a "minimum viable product" and test/ adopt it again and again (accounts for unintended consequences and complexity); Use randomise control trials; narrative fallacy (we are inclined to produce explenations and patterns to make sense of the world); "Our intuitions about what works are often wrong" (Toby Ord). Use honest pilot schemes to test interventions; Pre-mortem method.

**Example**: Evolution (natural selection) is based on failure testing and adapting. "Many areas of government have not been testedd in any form whatsoever. They are based on hunch, gut feel and narrative (David Halpern). Google is carying out thousands of A/B tests and other randomized control trials on their product every year. Challenge descisions with objective data; Get access to evidence thats shows were I might be wrong.

6. **Marginal Gains, improvements come with thousands of small adjustments**: Every failure is an opportunity to improve a system;

**Example**: Break down a big goal into smaller parts and improve each of them. Then use controlled trials for those smaller parts.

7. **Creativity**: Brainstorming improves when participants are encouraged to point out flaws in the ideas of others (Charlan Nemeth); Creativity comes from dissent with others; Creativity comes best as a response to a concret problem;

**Example**: N/A

## My favorite sentence from the book:
"We need to come up with elightened ways of making trial and error effective through the use of controlled trials and the like, and be more willing to iterate our way to success. As situations become more complex we will have to avoid the temptation to impose untested solutions from above and try to discover the world from below." (p. 302)
