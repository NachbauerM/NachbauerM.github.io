# 2023-05-21-Interesting:_Data Trust

A few considerations regarding Data Trust from the "Data framed" Podcast:

1. Data Trust ist based on the Quality and Timeliness of the Data.
2. A good data pipline is necesssary to establish Trust (usually relies on multiple people). Who owns a problem?
3. Metrics: Time to detect a problem, time to resolve a problem. Check irregularities in data freshness, volumn entered,distributions, lineage, dependencies (upstream, downstream).

My thoughts:
- Data Trust is very important in my work.
- Hard to establish esp. with fragil pipeline (e.g. lots of human intervention). 
- Hard to verify data quality through a fragile pipeline.
- Lots of Definitions / Templates necessary.
