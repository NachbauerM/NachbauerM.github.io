#Book:_Deep_Work by Cal Newport

This is a book about working in a more focused way. Together with the “Deep Work” Podcast it presents a lot of very nice tips to be more effective at work. Esp. for beginners. I used a different method to take notes and have probably lost some interesting information that way. Consider re-reading.

## Definitions
1.	Deep Work: “Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.” (P.3)
## Basic ideas
1.	Knowledge workers do a lot of “shallow work” with lots of context switches (emails, meetings etc.). (P.6)
2.	The Principle of least resistance: “In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend towards behaviors that are easiest in the moment.” (P. 58)
My Comments: This appears to be very true for me. Shifting focus to easy to achieve tasks (e.g. messages). Weekly Planning, communicated fixed deadlines, turning off all automated notifications helped somewhat.
3.	Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: “in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their job, many knowledge workers turn back towards and industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.” (P.64).
## Solutions
1.	Add routines and rituals to my work that support unbroken concentration (e.g. mark days with at least 1 hour of deep work P. 110). 
2.	Schedule fixed times for deep work (P. 112). No distractions during this time. Only one task. Be very clear what to do in this session (P.120). Even one hour is a lot of work (P.150).
3.	Focus on the important (often harder) tasks (P.136). Measure progress with indicators.
4.	Weekly planning and have a shutdown ritual at the end (P.151)
5.	Daily Planning: plan each hour of the workday P.221, readjust workplan after first session if necessary.
6.	Embrace boredom. Train your mind to do difficult, often boring tasks by sometimes being bored (P.157). This should improve concentration.
7.	Commit publicly to a deadline and keep it if possible (“So good they cant ignore you”).
8.	Productive meditation: learn to focus on one topic during walking, driving bicycle etc. (P.170). Improves attention control.
9.	Drain the shallow work (emails, meetings etc.) (P.216). Put it in Blocks itself (e.g. twice a day working the inbox for 30 minutes). Work on a common document instead of a meeting. Write emails in a way that make back and forth unnecessary ie. With enough information (P. 250).
10.	Say “No” if the schedule doesn’t allow more tasks.#

## Other Tips from the podcast that worked well for me:
1.	Capture tasks from emails in other formats (e.g. word doc) to avoid browsing through emails unnecessarily. 
2.	Turn of all notifications and popups. 
3.	Reminding myself on a regular basis on the rules for the deep work sessions.
4.	Avoid using the internet/phone wherever possible.
5.	If I´m more productive I can eighter work more or do other things with my time.
