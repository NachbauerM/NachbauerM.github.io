Michael E. Mann:

Different Strategies are employed to distract from the important issues. E.g. 
1. Personalisation: "carbon footprint" promoted by BP https://clear.ucdavis.edu/blog/big-oil-distracts-their-carbon-footprint-tricking-you-focus-yours. Asks us to stop climate change individually.

Source: https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector

E.g. Aviation is "only" 1.9% of emissions. 

2. Technological Solutions: Bridge Technologies are on the horizon (very uncertain).
3. Overload: The crisis is to big to solve anyway. No chance.

Advice: Global warming can not be solved on the individual level. International CO2 Price necessary.
