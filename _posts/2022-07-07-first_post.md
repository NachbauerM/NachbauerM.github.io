# Rational behind this blog

Following the advice and reasoning on this [Blogpost: Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), 
I`ll try to collect and structure my learnings on this blog.

The blog will contain the following kinds of posts:
1. Learnings from books I read (Posts will be marked with "Book:...")
2. Learnings from podcasts and other media (Interesting:...)
3. Math (Math:...)
4. Programming (Programming:...)
5. Machine Learning (Machine Learning:...)

LetÂ´s see how that goes.
