# Book: Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke

This bock lays out some methods for making better decisions in uncertain (almost any decision is uncertain) situations, as well as reasons why this might be important.

## Reasons why our decision making is often flawed

1.	“Resulting”: Resulting is our tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of the outcome. If the outcome is good, we think the decision was good and vice versa (similar to hindsight bias). After the fact it is often unclear which parts of an outcome are to be attributed to luck, good or bad decisions.
My own thoughts: For me that happens a lot because I don´t make reasons for a decision explicit. Therefor it is easy to misattribute outcomes to my convenience after the fact. This is also connected to the fact that I usually don’t have a contrafactual. Decisions should always be probabilistic.

2.	Biases and irrationalities: We are uncomfortable with the idea of luck and uncertainty (look for connections and a good story). Correlation vs. causation. We most often make decisions with very little information. We are uncomfortable to say “I´m not sure”. We make black and white statements instead of probabilistic ones always. Rashomon Effect (we give very different accounts of past events). Discounting the future. Tilt, emotional center of our brain starts to take over. Illusion of certainty (“I know”, “100%”…). Generalization about peoples opinions I don’t like. Motivated reasoning (we look for evidence that fits our narrative).  
My own thoughts: At least thinking to myself that “I`m not sure” should be the answer to every questions. Figure out how unsure I am.
Interesting: “The goal of the bookmaker is to make sure the amount of money bet on either side is equal, so that the losers essentially pay the winners while the bookmaker just takes their fee. The aim to have no stake in the outcome and adjust the odds accordingly. The bookmaker´s odds reflect the market´s view …:” (I didn’t know that this would work like that.)

3.	Belief formation: 1. We hear something; 2. We believe it to be true; 3. Only sometimes we check. In general, we are designed (evolutionary) to very easily believe and very difficult to doubt.
My own thoughts: In general, I think this is a nice feature, making human interaction much smoother and efficient. I also think that this heuristic works in most cases and might be self-reenforcing. 

4.	Learning from Decisions: “Fielding Error” we usually attribute bad stuff to luck and good outcomes to our decisions (and the other way around for other people). This makes it very hard to learn from decisions.

## Ways to work around those flaws:
1.	Thinking in bets: Decisions are bets on the future. Always ask “Wanna bet?” This will make us think more and makes us recognize the uncertainty. Beliefs are work in progress. Consider possible alternatives.
2.	Thinking probabilistic: Try to assign a probability (range) to decision outcomes. The less we know the bigger the range. Adapt the probabilities with new information coming in (Bayesian approach).
My own thoughts: This has served me very well at work. When I give an estimation or prediction, to shortly think about the probability ranges and communicate the range. It also has helped me a lot with assigning values to certain decisions (see expected value)

3.	Decisions Groups: Don’t leave out details. Don’t share the results of a decisions (outcome-blind analysis). Welcome scepticism. Express uncertainty. Universalism, apply uniform standards to evidence regardless where they came from.

4.	Communication outside Truth Seeking groups: Express uncertainty. Lead with assent (“and” instead of “but”). Ask for agreement to engage in truth-seeking or let the person vent. Focus on the future (we don’t like to engage with past errors). 

My own thoughts: This is very relevant to not enforce these ways of thinking on others who might not want that.

5.	Thinking about the future: “10-10-10” rule (how will I think about this issue in 10 days, 10 weeks, 10 months). Ulysses Contract (e.g. don’t have sweets at home). Reconnaissance, do work on the range of possible futures (scenario planning, makes uncertainty explicit), helps to assign probabilities (decisions trees). Backcasting, imagining a positive or negative outcome and work back on how I got there (esp. imagining negative outcomes is correlated with a higher likelihood of achieving a goal).
My own thoughts: The “10-10-10” rule has been very helpful, especially prioritizing relationship and family topics more over career moves or similar. It is a very nice heuristic to also deal with setbacks that might not be to bad after only a few weeks (will it really matter in the long run?).

6.	Expected Value: is the value of something (e.g. a grant) times its probability. 
My own thoughts: I think that could also help me in budget spending planning. Assigning probabilities to certain budget lines to calculate the expected value of each one.

## Favourite Quote form the Book:
Thinking in bets starts with recognizing that there are exactly two things that determine how lives turn out: the quality of our decisions and luck. Learning to recognize the difference between the two is what thinking in bets is all about. (P.4)
